# WikiShoot

**WikiShoot** is an iOS (iPhone and iPad) application allowing you to take photos of unphotographed locations and upload them to Wikimedia Commons (or some other MediaWiki deployment).

This is a contest entry for [Wikipedia's October 2011 Coding Challenge][wocc].

## Mockup

WikiShoot development follows [this rough UI mockup][wikishoot-mockup] showing how it should work.

## Status

Implemented:

* Minimal MediaWiki Cocoa API client, [CocoaMW][cocoamw].
* Unphotographed locations map (using GeoNames + MediaWiki APIs).
* Image picker.

Not (yet) implemented:

* Image upload functionality.
* Form to enter image's data.
* "Choose from list" unphotographed locations functionality.
* Ability to choose a "thing" (not a location) to photograph.
* License chooser.
* "User statistics" view.

## How to run

- Download and install Xcode 4 and iOS SDK 5. The [Mac App Store][xcode-ios-sdk] version has been tested, but other versions might work too.
- Clone this repository.
- Open `WikiShoot.xcodeproj`
- Build and run.

## Compatibility

(Should be) compatible with iOS 3.0 and up.
